# Coding Speed Type Tester
#### Video Demo:  <TODO>
#### Description:
Hello World!
This is my cs50 final project.
I've decided I wanted to build a speed typing tester for code since I began my coding journey.
I always averaged about 60 wpm writing in English and 70-80 wpm in Italian with an accuracy of about 90-95% in both.
It caught me by surprise how clunky and awkward i felt switching to typing code, and saw both my accuracy and speed tank drastically.

Right away I felt it being annoying, since it was an added difficulty trying to learn and troubleshoot code, while also adding extra typos and not being able to be up to speed with my thoughts.

I set a reminder in my notes app for a future project to build a coding speed tester/exercise.
Many other sites offer that, and I've found it very useful while sticking to the routine of exercising, but now I want to give my own spin to it and adopted it as my final project.

I'm planning on developing it as a Flask web app, in order to consolidate this course's teaching and build something useful to me from the ground up.
